      <p>
      I'm Tisha, a graphic designer with a deep passion for visual storytelling and creative expression. I specialize in branding, digital illustration, and user-focused design, crafting unique and impactful visuals that bring ideas to life. My goal is to create designs that not only look great but also connect with people. Outside of design, I find inspiration in art, nature, and continuous learning, always seeking new ways to push creative boundaries.
